## Welcome to Mishra Cafe!

This is a simple console-based cafe ordering system written in C. Customers can choose from a menu of items, place orders, and enjoy their selected items. The program runs in a loop until the customer decides to exit.

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have one, you can install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html) for Linux or [MinGW](http://mingw.org/) for Windows.

3. Compile the program using your C compiler:
